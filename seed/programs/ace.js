    "The Bachelor's program in Electrical Engineering (EE) with specialisation in Automation and Control Engineering offers scientific methods and skills for solving problems in practical settings. The  program leads to a Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) degree. Important objectives of the study program are the teaching of methodological and social competence in small seminar groups. In addition to the seminars, the students complete a large proportion of practical laboratory exercises and carry out projects that are intensively supervised by professors and teaching assistants. The Bachelor's program prepares students for engineering activities in the development of devices and systems in electrical energy and automation technology, project planning of electrical and automation systems and their operation, testing and maintenance.",

Further, the students learn the specifics and solution principles for the automatic control of selected renewable energy systems utilising the example of wind energy systems. The focus is on the model-based controller design for the partial and full-load range of a wind turbine. A controller design- oriented model is used to manage the entire design process from modelling through controller design in the frequency range, controller verification of the design model and finally the detailed overall plant model. The students acquire the ability to design and parameterise a suitable control engineering structure.",
